                    My first encounter with this unidentified L-shaped site was mediated by powerful satellite technologies that caught my disembodied attention. In an effort to locate the plot of a municipal phytoremediation test bed that I had read about, my bird’s-eye gaze hovered over the map, until I noticed an intricate design of greenery caught between an eerie industrial landscape and a blend domestic one. As I gathered from a 1982 map of Pointe-Aux-Trembles , a neighborhood in Tiohtià:ke/Montreal’s east end, part of the site was once, somewhere around the 80’s and the 90’s , a hazardous waste transfer station. Within just a few hectares of unceded land, about 200 tons of dangerous byproducts transited in a single year , before being “cleaned up”, namely shipped away and introduced into new environments.

                    From this aerial view, I could easily have though that the grounds were designed for a specific purpose: a park to remember about play, or an old cemetery to remember about love. And yet, it used to be just the opposite of that: a place to forget about waste. “Despite this forgetting, waste doesn’t really go away—it flows,” writes Myra J. Hird about the liveliness of landfills that “occupy ever-increasing geographies of space and time ”. The past accumulates and lives on to become what Rob Nixon calls an “incremental and accretive” slow violence of “delayed destruction ”. And on this site, it left a ghostly imprint forever re-enacting a past made of copper, lead, zinc, arsenic, Petroleum Hydrocarbons (PHCs) and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) . A past made of battery powered times, car rides and astronauts slowly sinking in a terrain adjacent to this city’s heavy industrial sector, comprised of refineries and petrochemical plants that fuels our carbon-made dreams since the early 20th century. Today, only remains the “offices” of a multinational company that provides environmental solutions said to turn any discarded material into a valuable resource. Any, excluding the perennial waste that is underneath them. What is more, in an article ‘presented’ by this very firm’s research institute, Carmella Gray-Cosgrove, Max Liboiron and Josh Lepawsky have written that any “human devised system” is a form of temporary containment, since “long-lived toxic and hazardous substances will continue to cause harm no matter where they are moved, and because they can persist in geological time.” . <i>It flows.</i> Could the current low-tech environmental rehabilitation test bed that uses plants, helped by microorganisms and fungi, to decrease the toxicity of the contaminated soils surrounding the firm be any different? To answer this, I traveled across this site’s multiscalar geographies, to learn more about this different kind of violence.

                <p>
                    After what seemed like a long journey in the arms of an unendingly bright Sunday afternoon, I reached a small parking lot in between houses, which lead to one of the site’s entrance. It invites me in. Moving along a trail of parallel weekends, the sound of outdoors activities and poolside fun erupted in my left ear, while a soft mechanic clamoring crept in my right one. <i>Immersing deeper, I find its tall green corridors mesmerizing.</i> As I walked, cloistered in between its young dancing willows and poplar, carefully planted in tight rows, I noticed some of them were cut down, allowing new shoots to emerge in the foreground of a deleterious yet striking background. Following its labyrinthic paths, I transited between landscapes, from the industrial to the domestic zones, and back again. They almost touch each other, but somehow, they must feel protected from the one’s waste and the other’s vulnerability by this tenuous patch of land.

                    I had not planned on going on any specific day of the week and yet, I chose the one that reminded me of this one thing: the oil never stops flowing. And nor does the labor that has to keep it going. The neighboring Suncor Montreal Refinery operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year . As I saw the pipelines that bordered the private grounds not too far from the site, I wished I could stop the oil from its tiring travels and let it rest for a while. Thinking about the liveliness of this ancient existent made me dream about distant spaces and distant times, when the sun’s power absorbed in plants, absorbed in dinosaurs, transubstantiated into a different kind of being, buried deep underneath, in its now disturbed resting place. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As accessible reserves of oil are depleting in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, we become, as suggested by Nixon, “more dependent on horrendously polluting tar sand petroleum”, which entails “heightened extractive costs and heightened environmental risks . Since, in 2018, on average 39% of the crude oil that was processed in Tiohtià:ke/Montreal came from what is currently Alberta and 58% from the so-called United States , it has to travels thousands of kilometers through aging, seeping pipelines. This is the case of Line 5, a highly contested pipeline built in 1953 that threads the Great Lakes region, affecting five indigenous tribes who have still have treaty rights guaranteeing their water’s quality for healthy fishes and spiritual practices . And yet, since 1968, it has failed 29 times and 1.1 million gallons of oil were spilled in the waters of the Great Lakes and their biodiverse surroundings . Steve Penfold writes: “Petroleum’s liquid character made it easy to transport but difficult to contain, flowing through pipelines and into tanks but oozing and spilling out of them as well .” In other words, the viscosity of oil turns it into an oozing, slow disaster.

                    <i>As I try to smell lilac flowers growing through a fence, a burst of wind penetrates my nostrils and my mouth, transporting with it the acrid smell of the industries.</i> This smell too never stops. Like the oil, it will continue to be exhausted from the funnels and cracks of the infrastructures meant to contain and control its spread. José A. Siles and Mercedes García-Sánchez wrote that PHCs are the most commonly found organic contaminants in the world, and it is a huge problem, since “[i]n humans, prolonged exposure to PHCs can produce damages on the central nervous system, dysfunction of the respiratory system, disruption of the endocrine system, and even cancer .” All the while, close to home, a study showed in 2016 that life expectancy in Pointe-Aux-Trembles is nine years less than in the West Island, Montreal’s greener, richer, opposite end. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, even if “given enough time, writes Hird and Kathryn Yusoff, everything becomes disgestable to bacteria ”, including PHCs, not everything survives long enough to benefit from the hungry little critters. Even more so, since their digestion is punctuated by seasonal changes that shapes its humanly managed ‘remediation potential’. In our northern climate, “[n]atural contaminant degradation rates […] can also be significantly slower than in temperate regions due to cold temperatures and limited moisture which can further slow microbial processes .” In other words, bacteria transform the social and natural strata of a neighborhood according to a temporality that constrats an industry unaffected by the specificity of place, and for which incoming and outcoming flows of capital only seems to accelerate, paced by our insatiable hunger for fossil fuels.

                <p>
                    And where do I stand in relation to this soil’s multiple temporalities? I wonder at what pace the petroleum residues travels in the rhizosphere un my feet, and into the roots, the trunks and the leaves I touch. <i>Does it circulate in this labyrinthic microcosms, just like I lost my way in this picturesque plantation?</i> And if I could follow them, where would it lead me? Would I find a resting place? Or would I land in a “parallel universe of bacterial-earth relation that is not just contaminating and coproducing strata”, but “constantly refiguring what strata actually is ”? And if so, how can I participate in this refiguring of our earth’s alchemy?

                <div class="subtitle1">The politics of remediation</div>
                <p>
                    Contrary to the popular representation of soil as inert dirt, Maria Puig de la Bellacasa, thinks of it as a living interdependent community. In a single teaspoon of rich soil, of which “only 1% soil microorganisms have been identified”, she writes, one could find “a billion bacteria, thousands of fungi, protozoa and nematodes ”. And, just like the soil it dries and depletes, waste too is an entity far from being inert. According to Elizabeth A. Povinelli, “capitalism sees all things as having the potential to create profit; that is, nothing is inherently inert, […] and anything can become something more with the right innovative angle .” This is exactly why late liberalism, she writes, insist on delimitating what is Life and what is Nonlife. It “polices the separations between forms of existence so that certain kinds can be subjected to different kinds of extractions .” As Sebastián Ureta and Patricio Flores explain, waste management programs are “above all, projects of power”. The resistance “to grant life to nonorganic entities is not casual”, they write, it is a strategy to “make them available to human appropriation ”. Just like we appropriate land by denying its vital forces and spiritual meaning to indigenous communities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soils, and land, can enact a multiplicity of marginalized viscous temporalities – multiverses – crossing the times of spirits, bacteria and oil. To get to know soil, writes Puig de la Bellacasa, is to experience alternative times that can “challenge traditional notions of technoscientific innovation ”. This alternative engagement with time evokes differences in productivity, that is to say, different ways of living and working. Moving away from efficiency and management, “the embodied experience of time in making time for soils ” is a way to care for it by immersing oneself in different life cycles.

                <p>
                    This is an important aspect of phytoremediation. As Michel Labrecque from the IRBV  told me during our interview, willows and poplars grow rapidly, creating dense rhizosphere that attracts microorganisms, who, in turn, will degrade some contaminants, while their roots will suck in others, translocating them from the soil to their leaves. To “manage” – or care for – plants, one has to be aware of these cycles, because remediation takes time. Even when the trees are fast runners, they will never compete against the high-cost, high-energy excavation services that can make things disappear quickly.

                <p>
                    As I return to the site, I see new piles of fresh soil. <i>Nothing is ever at rest. But the work is slower.</i> The continued human-engineered process of phytoremediation produces biomass who is defined by the bioindustry movement as a “recently living” form of waste, an “untapped resource” to create more value under the umbrella of bioenergy . Its “byproducts” can produce biochar which enriches the soil, or biofloculants which treats sewage water, amongst many other things, Labrecque tells me. This matter freshly out-of-life, full of contaminants, is then considered as an environmental liability that can be turned into a strategic asset . As Hird writes: “Modern capitalism defines waste entirely within economic terms as ‘simply resources out of place’, and concentrates on transforming it from the material detritus of industrialization into further economic potential .” It is so, because waste evolves in a liminal conceptual place where no clear definition of it is given . Waste’s body is ubiquitous, uncertain and shapeshifting. Waste is always more than just waste, both defined as (recent)Life under sustainability’s point of view and Nonlife, within extractivism, alternating between the two states depending on where you stand. Nonetheless, the promises are there. But the results take time. And while this is unfolding, the politics of greenwashing are thriving. Suncor Energy prides itself to be the first oil company to “reclaim a tailings pond” by transforming it “into a 220-hectare watershed, named Wapisiw Lookout, capable of supporting a variety of plants and wildlife ”, all the while firmly opposing the shutdown of Line 5, a project that is currently gaining a lot of traction in Michigan. The company has “contingency plans to continue supplying its refineries in Montreal” in case of emergencies; that is, it has more expensive plans . It simply chooses not to initiate them.

                <p>
                    How can we rethink remediation, to resist the technocratic strategies that only serve to perpetuate settler colonial logics? Josh Lepawsky, Max Liboiron and Arn Keeling argue that repair is often thought of as a temporal process, where the goal of remediation is to go back to a point in time before any damages were done . But how do we even grasp or measure a linear timeline of harm? If soils are ‘unnoticeable’ worlds “easy to neglect as we walk upon them ”, as Puig de la Bellacasa puts it, isn’t our societie’s disconnection from them reflect our disconnection with the land? And whose land? What if everything started when the Kanien'kehá:ka Nation got pushed out of Tiohtià:ke? What becomes of remediation then? According to Liboiron there is a fundamental relationship between the <i>ongoingness</i> of land dispossession and waste management, where measured and controlled pollution levels are indexes of settler colonial grip over the land . <i>This shakes me.</i> While I walk in a neighborhood I have very few ties with, how can I grasp the multiscalar histories of its different vulnerabilities, absent and present, past and future?

                <p>
                    Caitlynn Beckett and Arn Keeling argue that we should keep caution of remediation frameworks that are “premised on achieving some kind of end-point, where remediation is complete: waste is contained, the community engaged, justice issues addressed” and multiple forms of values are reclaimed. As stated in a IRÉC report, the Pointe-Aux-Tremble phytoremediation project could be very beneficial to the community of Montreal’s east-end, as it is home to many mixed and contaminated zones near actors that could push forward bioindustrial developments, including Montreal’s Jean-R. Marcotte Wastewater Treatment Centre. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But even if this project aims at healing ecologies, the authors suggest they often fail to “recognize the ongoingness and indeterminacy of both the material effects of landscape degradation and the social relations constituted through environmental damage and remediation .” In a very real sense, some practices can be good and still be colonial . And this is why remediation practices should always be aware of the dynamics that could further create and maintain forms of invisibility: invisible wasted spaces and invisible wasted bodies. This calls for a form of liability, responsibility and reciprocity, write the authors, which entails a commitment to the land over long periods of time . An ethics of vulnerability takes into account that not all beings, and not all people relate to or are affected by waste in the same way. Furthermore, this kind of ethics acknowledges “humans ultimate powerlessness” facing unknown and unanticipated “living and nonliving earth processes ”. It considered the unequal and unpredictable exposures of Pointe-Aux-Trembles to PHCs and other contaminants in the air, water and soil and acknowledges that “environmental and social justice is always part of waste remediation and containment .” It is perpetual care that has to deal with existing and incoming pollution and waste. A care that can deal with the seeping, leaching flows, patiently “reassembling precarious orderings” between beings and processes, patiently building new relationalities, “to momentarily appease” waste’s monstrous flow . As I see it, it calls for a different kind of kinship, that doesn’t stop at life. Like Zoe Todd, I want to learn from the ancient worlds, flowing underneath our feet. Some of them might be dangerous, but they are a “paradoxical kind of kin ” for whom I care. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And perhaps I can deal with this flow too, remembering the experiences of others , the experiences of this site until no proper distinction remains between me and the land. This remembering doesn’t tremble against the unknown future, it learns to live with it, just like it learns to live with waste. I visited the site a few times over the past weeks. And the more I go, the more it asserts its existence to me. As spring declines into summer, it becomes strikingly thicker and more vibrant. But the waste is still there. I will not forget this next time I go.
